# Rails Playground

Playground for [attempting] to learn Ruby on Rails.

I'm not sure how well this is going to go, there are things I both absolutely love and absolutely hate about Ruby.  But it seems like it would be a positive addition to my skillset.  I'm attempting to document the process (wins and losses) to assist in anyone else doing the same.

Please feel free to comment/document/etc any mistakes or misguided efforts I've made during the process.

- Sqlite for dev and prod, at this point it doesn't matter
- Debuggable
- Working
